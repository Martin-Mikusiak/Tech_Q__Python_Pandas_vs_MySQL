# 3.1 Marketing Campaign Success [Advanced]
# https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/514-marketing-campaign-success-advanced?code_type=2

# You have the marketing_campaign table, which records in-app purchases by users.
# Users making their first in-app purchase enter a marketing campaign, where they see call-to-actions for more purchases.
# Find how many users made additional purchases due to the campaign's success.
# The campaign starts one day after the first purchase.
# Users with only one or multiple purchases on the first day do not count, nor do users who later buy only the same products from their first day.


# Python

# Solution #1 - Using Self-Merge of the DataFrame with the Dense Rank of the date column per each user
import pandas as pd

df = marketing_campaign.sort_values(by=["user_id", "created_at", "product_id"]).drop(columns=["quantity", "price"])
df = df.assign(date_d_r = df.groupby(by="user_id")["created_at"].rank(method="dense"))

df_mrg = df[df["date_d_r"].gt(1)].merge(df[df["date_d_r"].eq(1)], how="left", on=["user_id", "product_id"])

users_count = df_mrg[df_mrg["created_at_y"].isna()]["user_id"].nunique()


# Solution #2 - Using 2x Dense rank of the date column - each of them with different .groupby()

# 3.3 Retention Rate
# https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/2053-retention-rate?code_type=2

# You are given a dataset that tracks user activity.
# The dataset includes information about the date of user activity, the account_id associated with the activity, and the user_id of the user performing the activity.
# Each row in the dataset represents a userâ€™s activity on a specific date for a particular account_id.
# Your task is to calculate the monthly retention rate for users for each account_id for December 2020 and January 2021.
# The retention rate is defined as the percentage of users active in a given month who have activity in any future month.
# For instance, a user is considered retained for December 2020 if they have activity in December 2020 and any subsequent month (e.g., January 2021 or later).
# Similarly, a user is retained for January 2021 if they have activity in January 2021 and any later month (e.g., February 2021 or later).
# The final output should include the account_id and the ratio of the retention rate in January 2021 to the retention rate in December 2020 for each account_id.
# If there are no users retained in December 2020, the retention rate ratio should be set to 0.
